# Project motivation
This project tries to find some coherences of Covid data in germany. It may be expanded in the future. 
So far, it covers the questions 
+ Q1: Did public health authorities became quicker or slower in reporting cases?
+ Q2: Is it more dangerous to live in a densly-populated city instead of rural areas?
+ Q3: Can we predict deaths from case-data?
